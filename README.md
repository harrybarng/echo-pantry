# echo-pantry
EchoPantry is a WIP toolkit that imports your pantry data, tracks stock and expiry dates, suggests cook-now recipes, flags items at risk of waste, and builds smart shopping lists so you buy only whatâ€™s needed, turning what you already have into actionable insights for waste-free, efficient meal planning.
