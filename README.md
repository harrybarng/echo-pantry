# Echo Pantry (WIP)
EchoPantry is a work-in-progress toolkit that imports your pantry inventory, tracks stock and expiry dates, flags items at risk of waste, suggests cook-now recipes, and builds smart shopping lists so you buy only what’s needed, turning what you already have into actionable insights for waste-free, efficient meal planning.

## Status
Planning & learning phase — no code yet (will be built in Python).

## Roadmap
- Refine inventory data model
- Add expiry-date alerts
- Develop recipe recommendations
- Build user interface
- Set up continuous integration
- Help Wanted
- Open an issue for questions or feedback.

## Contributing:
Fork the project, create a feature branch, and open a pull request. Draft PRs are welcome.

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to everyone working to reduce food waste and save a few extra pennies along the way 🍎💰
